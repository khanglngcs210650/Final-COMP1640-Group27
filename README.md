## Software Stack

Our project utilizes a robust software stack to ensure optimal performance and scalability:

### Back-end

- **.NET Core 8.0**: Leveraging the powerful features of .NET Core 8, our back-end architecture provides a strong foundation for developing essential application features. The flexibility and optimization improvements offered by .NET Core enable rapid development and seamless integration with other components of our software stack.

### Front-end

- **React 18**: For front-end development, we have chosen React 18.2, a renowned JavaScript framework renowned for its adaptability, reusability, and component-based architecture. The declarative nature of React empowers our team to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, resulting in an exceptional user experience across various devices and platforms.

### UI Library

- **TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI**: To streamline the design and development process of our user interface, we rely on TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI. TailwindCSS's utility-first approach facilitates rapid prototyping and customization, while HeadlessUI offers a collection of accessible and modular UI components, enhancing the consistency and accessibility of our application's user interface.

### Database

- **SQL Server (Production), SQLite (Development)**: For storing and managing application data, we employ SQL Server for production environments and SQLite for development. SQL Server provides robust data handling capabilities, ensuring data integrity and reliability in live deployments. Meanwhile, SQLite offers a lightweight and portable database solution for development environments, facilitating seamless collaboration and testing among team members.
